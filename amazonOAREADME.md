Reorder the logs using comparator(arrays.split(" ",2)).+(compaator)
no of islands(DFS for every one index element and change visited to 0)
competitors / review.lower().replace("^[a-z0-9]", "")(replace all special characters with empty space and then start collecting count of strings)
partition labels(check for max last occurrence of a character in the entire substring and find a index where the last occurrence of that character matches)
pattern matching
largest item association(sort the pairs, map pairs into hashmap i,j and j,i and do dfs to all the nodes and find the largest association using dfs)
