I recently gave the online assessment for twitter's 2022 Twitter Coding Challenge
These were the questions that i received:

Coloring the Blocks
Balanced Sales array
Reaching Points
University Career Fair
As far as i can see all these questions are repeated and 3 questions from 2019 online assessment and the other question is 4th most twitter frequent question. No matter in which year you are giving this online assessment you are going to get previous year questions with high probability.Even i didn't believe this until i gave the test and i didn't believe with my eyes that i got all repeated questions. So it's better if you see these previous questions before you give the test
These are the questions my friends got:

Note : This 4th questions is different from Palindromic Substring for this you need to find total and for the problem you need to find distinct.
My other friend got this problem Game Events

There are also a few of 2019 and 2020 posts i missed them.have a look at them.I will post some of the new ones if i find notify me if you see anything new.
So topic wise we can expect a greedy and a dp question and arrays or string mostly from other 2.

Also:
How many of you gave oa already?? If so did you receive any further communication regarding interviews.Also does anyone know about any past experiences regarding Twitter's response time for these applications and selection of interns?
For those who are really looking for career opportunities at Twitter, try to get a referral which is more effective rather than applying through careers portal. because i am hearing a lot from 2019 oa people that eventhough they solve all the problem they didn't receive any further communication.I think it will be same this year too.Even if you complete all questions it doesn't gurantee you a call.This is what i am hearing from many people
